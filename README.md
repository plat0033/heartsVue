# Hearts Vue

## Objective
Using what you know about the basics of the Vue Framework, create a standard deck of cards and deal out all the cards to the four players. 

## Requirements
The following requirements must be met in order to complete the assignment successfully:

### Step 1 
Clone this repository from GitHub. The repository contains an `index.html` file, `styles.css` file, and a `script.js` file. You may change any of the files as necessary. 

### Step 2 
Using the provided `suits` and `ranks` arrays and nested loops, create an array of objects. Each object will contain `suit` and `rank` property representing each card in a standard deck of cards.

*The computed array of objects should look something like this*
```js
[
  {"suit":"clubs","rank":2},
  {"suit":"clubs","rank":3},
  {"suit":"clubs","rank":4},
  {"suit":"clubs","rank":5},
  {"suit":"clubs","rank":6},
  ...
  {"suit":"spades","rank":"J"},
  {"suit":"spades","rank":"Q"},
  {"suit":"spades","rank":"K"},
  {"suit":"spades","rank":"A"}
]
```

### Step 3
Using the provide `shuffle()` function, shuffle the newly created deck of cards (Refer to the Shuffle Function section below). Store the results of the `shuffle()` to the provided game object. 

### Step 4
Using the shuffled deck and players object, deal out a card to each player one card at a time until every card has been dealt. Each player should have 13 cards.

### Step 5
Create a button for each player with the player's name on the button. Use the following button as a template. You may add additional attributes and classes as necessary.

```html
<button class="button">Player 1</button>
```

### Step 6
Add event handler to each button that will create and display the hand of each player, when the player's button is clicked. Use the following template for each card. You may add additional attributes and classes as necessary.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="number hearts">2</div>
  <div class="suit"><img src="images/hearts.png"></div>
  <div class="number hearts">2</div>
</div>
```
